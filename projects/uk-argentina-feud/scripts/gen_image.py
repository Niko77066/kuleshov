 "s01_1806":   f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: an old weathered account ledger book lies open with fanning aged pages, a quill pen and ink pot resting on it, evoking a very old debt/account. Accent gilt #C9932B page edges. Constraint: reads as an ancient account book being opened. {AVOID}.",
 "s03_invade": f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: a column of generic red-coated pixel soldiers advances up a colonial town street while townspeople silhouettes on flat rooftops tip cauldrons to pour fire down to repel them. Pixel colonial buildings. Constraint: an urban assault repelled from rooftops. No blood, no gore. {AVOID}.",
 "s03_trade":  f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: cattle, stacked wheat sacks and cargo crates being loaded onto a pixel steamship at a dock and a steam train, goods flowing out (an informal empire of trade). Constraint: beef and grain shipped out en masse. {AVOID}.",
 "s04_belgrano": f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: a lone warship in dark silhouette on a cold open sea, a faint submarine periscope wake line approaching — tense and ominous. Cold blue palette. Constraint: a warship shadowed at sea, ominous but BLOODLESS. No wreck, no sinking, no explosion, no bodies, no debris. {AVOID}.",
 "s04_sheffield": f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: a sea-skimming missile with a motion trail streaks toward a distant warship silhouette over the sea, restrained. Constraint: a missile about to reach a ship, tense not gory. No blast, no fire debris, no bodies. {AVOID}.",
 "s05_rattin": f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: a defiant footballer in a blue-and-white striped kit sits down stubbornly on a red carpet strip while two generic officials stand beside him. Constraint: a player defiantly sitting on a red carpet. {AVOID}.",

Visual proposition: a footballer in a DARK NAVY BLUE kit leaps and punches the ball into the goal with a raised fist, while a red-shirted pixel goalkeeper reaches up too late; pixel stadium crowd tiles behind.

 "s05_goal":   f"A finished 16:9 editorial still, {BASE}. Visual proposition: a footballer in a DARK NAVY BLUE kit dribbles the ball and slaloms past a row of four or five white-shirted defender sprites left behind, pixel motion-afterimages tracing the run toward the goal. Constraint: one player weaving past a line of defenders. {AVOID}.",
